Q1: What are the challenges that arise with automating saas admin portals?
A1: Challenges that arise with automating SaaS admin portals:
*   UI inconsistency: Each portal has a unique layout, flow, and structure.
*   Dynamic elements: React/Vue-based SPAs with dynamic element IDs and content.
*   Authentication complexity: MFA, CAPTCHA, rotating session tokens.
*   Frequent updates: UI changes break traditional automations fast.
*   Pagination and lazy loading: Data hidden behind scrolls or tabs.
*   Slower Innovation: APIs allow developers to build on top of the platform, extending its functionality and fostering innovation. Platforms without APIs may miss out on this benefit.
